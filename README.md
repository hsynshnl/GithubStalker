# Github Stalker

I am developing a project in Flutter using the Github API, called GithubStalker. The purpose of this project is to make daily updates to the codebase and review the code regularly so that we can track changes to the code over time. Additionally, I will be demonstrating the use of Dio structures and model structures in Flutter. This project is open source, and I aim to make it a valuable resource for the community.
